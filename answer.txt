Could you tell the difference among a list, a set and a dictionary?
- A list is a unordered and changeable array of items, you can add/delete/modify whatever you want. And it allow duplicates items 
- A set is a ordered and immutable array of items, once you initialize it, you can't change anything in it. Moreover, it don't allow duplicates
- And a dictionary is a key-value pair array. Commonly it is ordered array based on the key value, but it seems that until python 3.7 it is not ordered.
  Also it don't allow duplicates items
